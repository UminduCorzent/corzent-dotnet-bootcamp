## Day 7: Advanced Topics

### What I Did:
	- Converted database calls to async/await for better performance

### Key Concepts:
	- **Async/Await**: Enables non-blocking I/O and improves scalability
	- **Pagination**: Returns results in pages using `Skip` and `Take`
	- **Filtering/Sorting**: Allows dynamic query results based on user input

### Reflections:
Implementing best practices made my API feel much more like a production system. I now understand how each layer of the API contributes to clean, fast, and secure software.
