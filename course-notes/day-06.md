## Day 6: API Security & Middleware

### What I Did:
	- Implemented JWT authentication with secret key validation
	- Protected routes using [Authorize]
	- Created custom middleware to log requests
	- Added structured logging using `ILogger<T>`

### Key Concepts:
	- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Secure token used to authenticate users
	- **Authentication**: Verifying the user's identity
	- **Authorization**: Checking if user has permission to perform an action
	- **Middleware**: Code that runs during request/response pipeline
	- **Logging**: Tracking system events for audit/debug

### Reflections:
Implementing JWT gave me real-world authentication experience. I also learned how proper logging helps with debugging.
